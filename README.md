# CustomizePlus

A proof of concept for an application or Dalamud plugin that sets a characters bone scales permanantely (outside of gpose, through loading screens, etc) from an Anamnesis .Pose File.

The goal of this project is to allow users to load appearance modifications like these: https://www.xivmodarchive.com/modid/29841 in a more permanant manner.

To apply a pose scale set to an actor, create a folder `Poses/` next to the executable, and place any pose files you want with the name of the actor. 
For example, if your character name is "Yoship Sampo" then you would need a file at `Poses/Yoship Sampo.pose`

This project is currently in the Proof-Of-Concept phase, the code is not pretty, and should not be used by anyone.
