# Customize+
Customize+ is a plugin for Dalamud that allows you to create and apply [Anamnesis](https://github.com/imchillin/Anamnesis)-style body scaling full time.

### Installing Alpha Builds
Add the following URL to the Dalamud Custom Plugin Repositories list:  
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XIV-Tools/CustomizePlus/main/repo.json`  
If you need your hand held through this process, then this plugin isn't for you. Please be patient and wait for a more stable build.

### How do I report an issue with Customize+?
Please use the [Issue tab](https://github.com/XIV-Tools/CustomizePlus/issues) to report issues with Customize+. Issues reported on Discord will be removed.

### Where do I learn how to use Customize+?
Customize+ is in an alpha state, and is released more as a proof of concept, so is not intended for widespread use. As such, there is no documentation outlining how to use the tool, as this may not be for you unless you yourself are a developer and are interested in contributing.

### When will it be fully released?
A release date cannot be forecast this early on, as this is an infant project worked on in the developers' free time. Real life and paid employment take priority over development of free tools for a subscription MMO for which the developers receive no compensation.
